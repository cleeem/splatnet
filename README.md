s3s is _free software_ licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html). This means that you have _freedom_ ‚Äì to run, modify, copy, share, and redistribute this work as you see fit, as long as derivative works are also distributed under these same or equivalent terms.

Copyright is a recent, confusing, and often unnecessary human invention. Libraries, for example, predate copyright by thousands of years, and their integral role in the "promotion of science" and "encouragement of learning" was acknowledged even before the first copyright statutes were enacted. If the first human who had the idea of a hammer claimed it as their intellectual property, we wouldn't have gotten very far as a species. Please consider sharing your work openly with the world. _(statement adapted from [here](https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/89456/1/Katz%20Copyright%2C%20Exhaustion.pdf) and [here](https://rickey.info/about/))_

While this is a free/libre and open-source project, its license does require **attribution**. **If you are using any part of s3s, splatnet2statink, `iksm.py`, etc. in your project, _please provide a link back to this repository_**. I have spent over half a decade and hundreds of hours of my personal time on these projects for the Splatoon community ‚Äì so, at the least, some credit would be nice. :) Donations, via the "Sponsor" button at the top or links in the sidebar, are also greatly appreciated. Thank you, and stay fresh! ‚Äìeli Ôºú„Ç≥:ÂΩ°
